        question: "What does CAVU mean?",
        answer: "CAVU stands for 'Ceiling And Visibility Unlimited'—pilot terminology meaning perfect flying conditions with unlimited visibility. For us, it symbolizes the clarity and transparency we strive to give our clients in their AI journey. When the clouds clear and visibility is unlimited, you can navigate with precision toward your goals."
      },
      {
        question: "How is CAVU AI different from other AI consultants?",
        answer: "We combine 30+ years of experience from high-stakes environments—both in fighter aircraft and defense industry—with deep understanding of AI and Systems Engineering. Where others focus only on technology, we see the whole system: people, processes, culture, and technology. Our background from JAS 39 Gripen E gives us unique perspective on how to integrate AI in complex, safety-critical environments."
      },
      {
        question: "What types of organizations do you work with?",
        answer: "We work with organizations facing complex challenges where clarity is critical: defense industry, tech companies, public sector, and companies in transformation. What our clients have in common is that they value systems thinking, want strategic advice—not just technology delivery—and understand that AI transformation is about people as much as machines."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does a typical project take?",
        answer: "It varies depending on scope, but most engagements follow a 3-6 month rhythm: 4-6 weeks for Discovery, 6-8 weeks for Design and Prototyping, and 8-12 weeks for Delivery and Implementation. We work agile and deliver value early—not at the end. Many clients then choose to continue with us in the Development phase for continuous improvement."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you work on-site or remote?",
        answer: "Flexible based on your needs. For the Discovery phase, we prefer to be on-site to truly understand your operations and culture. During Design and Delivery, we blend on-site workshops with remote work. We have experience leading multinational teams and are used to collaborating effectively regardless of geography."
      },
      {
        question: "What does it cost to work with you?",
        answer: "Our engagements are tailored, so investment varies depending on scope and complexity. We focus on value, not hours. After an initial strategy meeting (complimentary), we provide a clear proposal based on your specific needs. Many clients see ROI within the first quarter through more efficient processes and better decisions."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you ensure knowledge transfer?",
        answer: "We build capacity internally within your organization—not dependence on us. Throughout the project, we work closely with your teams, coaching, training, and documenting. The goal is for you to be able to drive your AI journey yourself when we're done. We 'teach you to fish' instead of giving you the fish. Many clients still choose to keep us as strategic advisors long-term."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you only work with AI, or other areas too?",
        answer: "AI is often the core, but we take a holistic perspective. Systems Engineering is about seeing connections—so we work with automation, process optimization, decision support, organizational development, and leadership. If AI isn't the right solution for your specific challenge, we'll say so. Our goal is always your success, not selling a particular technology."
